<h2><u> Background</u></h2>

Computational biologist specializing in causal and mechanistic modelling of cellular systems, integrating large-scale single-cell multi-omics datasets into transparent, reproducible frameworks that yield experimentally validated biological discoveries. Proven ability to bridge computation and biology, collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive therapeutic discovery and mechanistic inference. Experienced across biotech, pharma, and start-up ecosystems, with training in entrepreneurship and strategy. Driven to apply systems biology expertise to accelerate drug discovery.
