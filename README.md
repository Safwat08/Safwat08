<h2><u> Background</u></h2>

Computational biologist  specializing in modelling cellular systems via integrating large-scale single-cell multi-omics datasets into transparent, reproducible frameworks that yield experimentally validated biological discoveries. Applied ML Scientist with experience building multimodal MRI-clinical deep learning models. Proven ability to bridge computation and biology, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive therapeutic discovery and mechanistic inference. Experienced across biotech, pharma, and start-up ecosystems, with training in entrepreneurship and strategy. Driven to integrate systems biology and deep learning to accelerate drug discovery.
